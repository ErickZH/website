As part of the PXP project we are developing a brand new language server called `pls` for PXP _and_ PHP projects.

There are already a handful of language servers for PHP projects:
* Intelephense
* PHP Intellisense
* PHP Tools for Visual Studio Code

The problem with these tools is that they are either unmaintained, closed source or follow a freemium model.

Our goal is to enhance the developer experience for all PHP developers, regardless of what editors or framework you use, with a **free** language server.
