PXP can be installed on a per-project basis with Composer.

```sh
composer require pxp/pxp
```

The package provides a command-line application for interacting with the transpiler and tools.

Once installed, initialise your project configuration with the following command.

```sh
pxp init
```

This will create a `pxp.json` file in the current directory.
