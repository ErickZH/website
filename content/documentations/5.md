PXP tries to maintain compatibility with existing tooling by providing plugins or extensions to support the new language syntax. Sometimes this is not feasible since tools do not offer a public API for changing how things are parsed or tokenised.

One of the tools where this is the case is PHP-CS-Fixer, arguably the most popular code formatting tool for PHP.

Code formatting is a complex task and there are lots of opinions surrounding the "right" way of formatting your code. Inspired by the Python formatter [`psf/black`](https://github.com/psf/black), PXP's formatter for PHP and PXP code takes away most of that control and enforces a particular code style.

The code style that it enforces follows [PER-1](https://www.php-fig.org/per/coding-style/) very closely.

If you've got PXP installed and want to give the formatter a go, run `pxp fmt` in the root of your project and `git diff` the changes it makes.
