The default configuration file contains the JSON below.

```
{
    "paths": [
        "app"
    ],
    "transpiler": {
        "strictTypes": false
    },
    "watch": {
        "paths": [
            // ...
        ]
    }
}
```

### Configuration Options

#### paths

This configuration option should contain an array of paths that contain PXP files.

#### transpiler.strictTypes

When enabled, all generated PHP files will contain strict type declarations as below.

```php
declare(strict_types = 1);
```

#### watch.paths

When running the `pxp build` command with the `--watch` or `-w` flags, all paths inside of `paths` will be watched, as well as `vendor`.

In some cases, you might want to watch additional paths for changes and force transpilation. This can be done by specifying a list of paths inside of the `watch.paths` array.
